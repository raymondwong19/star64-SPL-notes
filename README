First, this is done on a Debian chroot, Bookworm in particular, althrough I think Ubuntu Jammy might have worked better in terms of GCC version. But Debian based distros will have screen and lrzsz ready to go from apt.
Now connect the UART. On the Star64 it's on the 40-pin GPIO at the usual Pi spots. Using a ROCKPro64, RP64 TX to S64 RX, RP64 RX to S64 TX, and GND pin 4 to GND pin 4.
There is a pair of toggles shown on the Wiki, 0 0 is SPI, 0 1 is SD, and 1 1 is UART. 1 0 is eMMC. For UART boot at 1 1, the basics goes there using that StarFive set of tools.
### cd to $HOME and run screen
$ screen -m -S star64 /dev/STAR64_CONSOLE 115200
### open a second shell and cd to the same $HOME directory you stored your bins
$ screen -S star64 -X exec \!\! sx jh7110-recovery-20230322.bin
### option 0 on Star64
$ screen -S star64 -X exec \!\! sx u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out
### option 2 on Star64
$ screen -S star64 -X exec \!\! sx u-boot.itb
### Then you can press option 5 on the Star64, flip switches back to 0 0 and reset.
